# Tekton Pipeline for Building RPMs

This is the **upstream flavor** of the Tekton RPM Build Pipeline, which allows
you to easily build RPMs in [Konflux][].  You can either:

- **Copy-paste** the pipeline code into your own project (if you need to
  customize it), or
- **Reference** it using the [Git resolver][] (preferred if the predefined logic
  and [parameters](docs/parameters.md) work for you).

The key characteristic of the *upstream flavor* is that it is
**distribution-agnostic** â€” unlike the [Fedora flavor][], which depends on
Fedora-specific infrastructure like Koji.


## How It Works

In short, based on the provided [parameters](docs/parameters.md), the pipeline
retrieves RPM package source code from a [DistGit][]-like repository and builds
RPMs using [Mock][].  The pipeline allocates architecture-specific workers to
run *Mock* builds in the appropriate environment.

For more technical details, see the [architecture
overview](docs/architecture.md).

building!**
